"""Best-effort helpers to provision configuration entities.

This module previously relied on Home Assistant helper factory functions that are
not available in all installations (for example,
``input_number.async_create_input_number``). Attempting to call those functions
would block setup entirely. The implementation below intentionally avoids
calling missing helper APIs so the Shutter Control integration can continue to
load even when the dynamic helper creation features are unavailable.
